## Notice

This is a very outdated and unmaintained game engine I started developing using CodeIgniter years ago. There won't be anymore work on this, but the source is here just incase anyone can find any use for it. 

## Update! Version 3

Otherwise I have started what will basically be a completely new version of CloudRealms written in Javascript and HTML5. The new CloudRealms works more like an actual game engine and javascript framework, but also will include a map builder. It can be used to develop both online and offlline 2D birds eye view RPG games in the web.

You can find the new Cloudrealms game engine development on Github at [@cloudrealmsrpg](https://github.com/cloudrealmsrpg)
